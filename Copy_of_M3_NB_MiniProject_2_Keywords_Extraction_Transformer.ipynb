He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint.  He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success.  He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point.  He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful.  Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time.  Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee.  After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella.  The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.  After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics.\",\n          \"REASON FOR CONSULT:,  Depression.,HPI:,  The patient is an 87-year-old white female admitted for low back pain status post hip fracture sustained a few days before Thanksgiving in 2006.

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.  Specimens produced were right and left tonsils.  The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery.\",\n          \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Suspicious microcalcifications, left breast.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Suspicious microcalcifications, left breast.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Needle-localized excisional biopsy, left breast.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local with sedation.,SPECIMEN:  ,Left breast with specimen mammogram.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 71-year-old black female who had a routine mammogram, which demonstrated suspicious microcalcifications in the left breast.  She had no palpable mass on physical exam.  She does have significant family history with two daughters having breast cancer.  The patient also has a history of colon cancer.  A surgical biopsy was recommended and she was scheduled electively.,PROCEDURE:,  After proper informed consent was obtained, she was placed in the operative suite.  This occurred after undergoing preoperative needle localization.  She was placed in the operating room in the supine position.  She was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The skin was infiltrated with local and a curvilinear incision was made in the left lower outer quadrant.  The breast tissue was grasped with Allis clamps and a core of tissue was removed around the localization wire.  There were some fibrocystic changes noted.  The specimen was then completely removed and was sent to Radiology for mammogram.  The calcifications were seen in specimen per Dr. X.  Meticulous hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The area was irrigated and suctioned.,The aspirant was clear.  The skin was then reapproximated using #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressing on the patient's bra were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE DONE:  ,Resting Myoview and adenosine Myoview SPECT.,INDICATIONS:,  Chest pain.,PROCEDURE:,  13.3 mCi of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected and resting Myoview SPECT was obtained.  Pharmacologic stress testing was done using adenosine infusion.  Patient received 38 mg of adenosine infused at 140 mcg/kg/minute over a period of four minutes.  Two minutes during adenosine infusion, 31.6 mCi of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected.  Resting heart rate was 90 beats per minute.  Resting blood pressure was 130/70.  Peak heart rate obtained during adenosine infusion was 102 beats per minute.  Blood pressure obtained during adenosine infusion was 112/70.  During adenosine infusion, patient experienced dizziness and shortness of breath.  No significant ST segment, T wave changes, or arrhythmias were seen.,Resting Myoview and adenosine Myoview SPECT showed uniform uptake of isotope throughout myocardium without any perfusion defect.  Gated dynamic imaging showed normal wall motion and normal systolic thickening throughout left ventricular myocardium.  Left ventricular ejection fraction obtained during adenosine Myoview SPECT was 77%.  Lung heart ratio was 0.40.  TID ratio was 0.88.,IMPRESSION:,  Normal adenosine Myoview myocardial perfusion SPECT.  Normal left ventricular regional and global function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 77%.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3816,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"surgery, femoral-popliteal angiogram, carotid cerebral angiogram, internal carotid artery, carotid artery, angiogram, carotid, cerebral, artery,\",\n          \"orthopedic, cervical nodal, mass lesion, deep lobe, deep lateral, lateral cervical, parotid gland, cervical, lesion, gland, parotid, deep\",\n          \"hematology - oncology, neuro oncology, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic, oncology, radiation, astrocytoma\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The patient has elevated white count on exam and CT scan consistent with acute appendicitis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A periumbilical incision was made.  The fascia was incised.  Peritoneal cavity entered bluntly.  A 10-mm trocar and scope was passed.  Peritoneal cavity was insufflated.  Five-mm ports placed in left lower and hypogastric areas.  On visualization of the right lower quadrant, appendix was visualized stuck against the right anterior abdominal wall, there is obvious site of perforation and leakage of content and pus.  We proceeded to take the mesoappendix down to the base, and once the base was free, we placed GIA stapler across the base, fired the stapler, removed the appendix through the periumbilical port site.  We irrigated and suctioned out the right lower and pelvic areas.  We then removed the ports under direct visualization, closed the periumbilical port site fascia with 0 Vicryl, all skin incisions with 5-0 Monocryl, and dressed with Steri-Strips.  The patient was extubated in the operating table and taken back to recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.\",\n          \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Nausea.,PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 28-year-old, who is status post gastric bypass surgery nearly one year ago.  He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back.  He feels like he was on it but has not done so.  He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3.  He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms.  His last normal bowel movement was yesterday.  He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for hypertension and morbid obesity, now resolved.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Gastric bypass surgery in December 2007.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Multivitamins and calcium.,ALLERGIES: , None known.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Positive for diabetes mellitus in his father, who is now deceased.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He denies tobacco or alcohol.  He has what sounds like a data entry computer job.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  His temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84.  He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation.  He is oriented to person, place, and situation.  He is normocephalic, atraumatic.  His sclerae are anicteric.  His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky.  His neck is supple and symmetric.  His respirations are unlabored and clear.  He has a regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is soft.  He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding.  He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident.  His extremities are symmetrical with no edema.  His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric.  He is grossly nonfocal neurologically.,STUDIES:,  His white blood cell count is 8.4 with 79 segs.  His hematocrit is 41.  His electrolytes are normal.  His bilirubin is 2.8.  His AST 349, ALT 186, alk-phos 138 and lipase is normal at 239.,ASSESSMENT: , Choledocholithiasis, ? cholecystitis.,PLAN: , He will be admitted and placed on IV antibiotics.  We will get an ultrasound this morning.  He will need his gallbladder out, probably with intraoperative cholangiogram.  Hopefully, the stone will pass this way.  Due to his anatomy, an ERCP would prove quite difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted.  Dr. X will see him later this morning and discuss the plan further.  The patient understands.\",\n          \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nasopharyngeal mass.,2.  Right upper lid skin lesion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nasopharyngeal tube mass.,2.  Right upper lid skin lesion.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Functional endoscopic sinus surgery.,2.  Excision of nasopharyngeal mass via endoscopic technique.,3.  Excision of right upper lid skin lesion 1 cm in diameter with adjacent tissue transfer closure.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 30 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 51-year-old Caucasian female with a history of a nasopharyngeal mass discovered with patient's chief complaint of nasal congestion and chronic ear disease.  The patient had a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy performed in the office which demonstrated the mass and confirmed also on CT scan.  The patient also has had this right upper lid skin lesion which appears to be a cholesterol granuloma for numerous months.  It appears to be growing in size and is irregularly bordered.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed to the patient, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was turned to 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  The right upper eyelid skin lesion was injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 1 cc total.  After this, the patient's bilateral nasal passages were then packed with cocaine-soaked cottonoids of 10% solution of 4 cc total.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the right upper lid skin was then first cut around the skin lesion utilizing a Superblade.  After this, the skin lesion was then grasped with a ________ in the  superior aspect and the skin lesion was cut and removed in the subcutaneous plane utilizing Westcott scissors.  After this, the ________ was then hemostatically controlled with monopolar cauterization.  The patient's skin was then reapproximated with a running #6-0 Prolene suture.  A Mastisol along with a single Steri-Strip was in place followed Maxitrol ointment.  Attention then was drawn to the nasopharynx.  The cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx.  The patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left.  There appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect.  The nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total.  After this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the XPS blade.  The torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely.  This area was taken down with the XPS blade.  Prior to taking down this lesion with the XPS, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter.  After this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side.  The zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx.  Again, the XPS was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius.  After this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned Bovie cauterization.  A FloSeal was then placed followed by bilateral Merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment.  The patient's Meroceles were then tied together to the patient's forehead and the patient was then turned back to the Anesthesia.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent home and with instructions to followup approximately in one week.  The patient will be sent home with a prescription for Keflex 500 mg one p.o. b.i.d, and Tylenol #3 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. pain #30.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3815,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"surgery, ruptured distal biceps tendon, gentamicin solution, antecubital fossa, distal biceps, biceps tendon, tendon, tuberosity, biceps, elbow,\",\n          \"orthopedic, intracranial disease, motor vehicle collision, orbital nerves, extra-ocular muscles, cervical spine, ct cervical spine, ct facial bones, ct head, axial ct images, facial bone fracture, facial bones, ct, noncontrast, intracranial, axial, spine, fracture, cervical, contrast, facial, bones, \",\n          \"hematology - oncology, oral ulcer, leukemia, anemia, hemolysis, blood count, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic, cll, lymphocytic, autoimmune, \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

scan consistent with acute appendicitis.,description of procedure: , the patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia.  the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  a periumbilical incision was made.  the fascia was incised.  peritoneal cavity entered bluntly.  a 10-mm trocar and scope was passed.  peritoneal cavity was insufflated.  five-mm ports placed in left lower and hypogastric areas.  on visualization of the right lower quadrant, appendix was visualized stuck against the right anterior abdominal wall, there is obvious site of perforation and leakage of content and pus.  we proceeded to take the mesoappendix down to the base, and once the base was free, we placed gia stapler across the base, fired the stapler, removed the appendix through the periumbilical port site.  we irrigated and suctioned out the right lower and pelvic areas.  we then removed the ports under direct visualization, closed the periumbilical port site fascia with 0 vicryl, all skin incisions with 5-0 monocryl, and dressed with steri-strips.  the patient was extubated in the operating table and taken back to recovery

ago.  he has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back.  he feels like he was on it but has not done so.  he has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3.  he denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms.  his last normal bowel movement was yesterday.  he denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.,past medical history: , significant for hypertension and morbid obesity, now resolved.,past surgical history: , gastric bypass surgery in december 2007.,medications:  ,multivitamins and calcium.,allergies: , none known.,family history:  ,positive for diabetes mellitus in his father, who is now deceased.,social history: , he denies tobacco or alcohol.  he has what sounds like a data entry computer job.,review of systems:  ,otherwise negative.,physical examination:,  his temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84.  he is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation.  he is oriented to person, place, and situation.  he is normocephalic, atraumatic.  his sclerae are anicteric.  his mucous membranes are somewhat tacky.  his neck is supple and symmetric.  his respirations are unlabored and clear.  he has a regular rate and rhythm.  his abdomen is soft.  he has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding.  he otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident.  his extremities are symmetrical with no edema.  his posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric.  he is grossly nonfocal neurologically.,studies:,  his white blood cell count is 8.4 with 79 segs.  his hematocrit is 41.  his

closure.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal.,estimated blood loss: , less than 30 cc.,complications: , none.,indications for procedure: , the patient is a 51-year-old caucasian female with a history of a nasopharyngeal mass discovered with patient's chief complaint of nasal congestion and chronic ear disease.  the patient had a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy performed in the office which demonstrated the mass and confirmed also on ct scan.  the patient also has had this right upper lid skin lesion which appears to be a cholesterol granuloma for numerous months.  it appears to be growing in size and is irregularly bordered.  after risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed to the patient, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.,procedure: , the patient was brought to the operating suite by anesthesia and placed on the operating table in supine position.  after this, the patient was turned to 90 degrees by the department of anesthesia.  the right upper eyelid skin lesion was injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 1 cc total.  after this, the patient's bilateral nasal passages were then packed with cocaine-soaked cottonoids of 10% solution of 4 cc total.  the patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the right upper lid skin was then first cut around the skin lesion utilizing a superblade.  after this, the skin lesion was then grasped with a ________ in the  superior aspect and the skin lesion was cut and removed in the subcutaneous plane utilizing westcott scissors.  after this, the ________ was then hemostatically controlled with monopolar cauterization.  the patient's skin was then reapproximated with a running #6-0 prolene suture.  a mastisol along with a single steri-strip was in place followed maxitrol ointment.  attention then was drawn to the nasopharynx.  the cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx.  the patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left.  there appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect.  the nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking.  it was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total.  after this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the xps blade.  the torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely.  this area was taken down with the xps blade.  prior to taking down this lesion with the xps, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter.  after this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side.  the zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx.  again, the xps was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius.  after this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned bovie cauterization.  a floseal was then placed followed by bilateral merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment.  the patient's meroceles were then tied together to the patient's forehead and the patient was then turned back to the anesthesia.  the patient was extubated in the operating room and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and sent home and with instructions to followup approximately in one week.  the patient will be sent home with a

She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.  Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks.  A prescription was written as well. REASON FOR VISIT:,  Lap band adjustment.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. A is status post lap band placement back in 01/09 and she is here on a band adjustment.  Apparently, she had some problems previously with her adjustments and apparently she has been under a lot of stress.  She was in a car accident a couple of weeks ago and she has problems, she does not feel full.  She states that she is not really hungry but she does not feel full and she states that she is finding when she is hungry at night, having difficulty waiting until the morning and that she did mention that she had a candy bar and that seemed to make her feel better.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, her temperature is 98, pulse 76, weight 197.7 pounds, blood pressure 102/72, BMI is 38.5, she has lost 3.8 pounds since her last visit.  She was alert and oriented in no apparent distress.  ,PROCEDURE:  ,I was able to access her port.  She does have an AP standard low profile.  I aspirated 6 mL, I did add 1 mL, so she has got approximately 7 mL in her band, she did tolerate water postprocedure.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient is status post lap band adjustments, doing well, has a total of 7 mL within her band, tolerated water postprocedure.  She will come back in two weeks for another adjustment as needed.,')\n",
