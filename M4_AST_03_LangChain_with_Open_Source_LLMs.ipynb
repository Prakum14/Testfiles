Gandhi's satyagraha cool down campaign led by the Indian National Congress attracted national and global attention, marking a turning point in the non-violent movement for independence.\n",

During the Quit India movement of 1942, Gandhi gave a historic \"Do or Die\" speech urging the Indian people to launch a mass civil disobedience movement for total independence, no matter what the cost.

To mitigate the communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims, Gandhi organized an All India Muslim Conference In Delhi in 1942, advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity over the formation of Pakistan. Unfortunately, Gandhi's efforts fell short, leading to the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 and placing Gandhi at the forefront of India's struggle for independence.\n"

            "1. Learn a programming language: Python is a great language for beginners because it's easy to read and write, and it has a wide range of applications. You can start by learning the basics of Python, such as variables, data types, and control structures, and then move on to more advanced topics like functions, modules, and object-oriented programming. There are many online resources available to help you learn Python, such as Codecademy, W3Schools, and the official Python documentation. 2. Build a project: Once you have a basic understanding of a programming language, it's a good idea to start working on a project. This will give you practical experience and help you apply what you've learned. Some project ideas for beginners include creating a simple calculator, building a to-do list, or making a basic website. You can find many tutorials and resources online to help you get started with your project. 3. Join a coding community: There are many online communities where you can connect with other programmers and learn from their experiences. Some popular coding communities include Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Reddit's r/learnprogramming subreddit. These communities can be a great place to ask questions, get feedback on your code, and learn about new tools and technologies. 4. Read books: There are many books available that can help you learn programming. Some popular programming books for beginners include \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" by Al Sweigart, \"Python Crash Course\" by Eric Matthes, and \"Eloquent JavaScript\" by Marijn Haverbeke. These books can provide a more in-depth understanding of programming concepts and help you develop your skills. 5. Practice coding regularly: Like any other skill, the more you practice programming, the better you'll become. Try to set aside some time each day to practice coding, even if it's just for a few minutes. You can use websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Exercism to find coding challenges and problems to solve. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with programming concepts and the faster you'll be able to solve problems.\n"

Additionally, completed projects can serve as valuable additions to your portfolio.\n"
